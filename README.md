# Lightmask 2D

A pack of Lightmask I made to be used inside Godot with the Light2D. They can be used inside other software without any problems.
Some can be weird but I keep everything I made because they had interesting effect inside Godot and could be usefull in some situations.
I will make more of these and add them inside this repository.
